# Tasks README

Welcome to the repository for JavaScript tasks focusing on promises, async/await, and error handling. Each task provides a specific challenge to test your understanding and implementation of promises and related concepts.

## Installation

To run these tasks locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-javascript/0x01-ES6_promise
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Each task has its own JavaScript file with an associated test file for execution. You can execute each task by running the respective main file.

### Task Execution

To execute a specific task, run the corresponding main file:

```bash
npm run dev <task_number>-main.js
```

Replace `<task_number>` with the task number you want to execute.

## Task Overview

1. **Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep**: This task focuses on returning a Promise using a given prototype function.

2. **Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it**: Here, you need to return a promise based on a boolean argument, resolving or rejecting it accordingly.

3. **Catch me if you can!**: This task involves appending handlers to a function that handles promise resolution and rejection.

4. **Handle multiple successful promises**: In this task, you'll handle multiple successful promises and log the results.

5. **Simple promise**: You'll create and return a resolved promise with specific attributes.

6. **Reject the promises**: Write a function returning a promise rejecting with a specific error message.

7. **Handle multiple promises**: Here, you'll handle multiple promises and return the value of the first resolved promise.

8. **Throw error / try catch**: Write a function that throws an error under certain conditions.

9. **Throw an error**: Create a function that processes another function and handles potential errors.

10. **Await / Async**: Import functions, call them asynchronously, and return an object based on their responses.
