# ES6 Data Manipulation Tasks

Welcome to the repository for JavaScript tasks focusing on ES6 data manipulation. Each task provides a specific challenge to test your understanding and implementation of ES6 features such as array methods (map, filter, reduce), sets, typed arrays, maps, and more.

## Installation

To run these tasks locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-javascript/0x03-ES6_data_manipulation
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Each task has its own JavaScript file with an associated test file for execution. You can execute each task by running the respective main file.

### Task Execution

To execute a specific task, run the corresponding main file:

```bash
npm run dev <task_number>-main.js
```

Replace `<task_number>` with the task number you want to execute.

## Task Overview

1. **Basic list of objects**: Create a function named `getListStudents` that returns an array of objects with specified attributes.

2. **More mapping**: Create a function `getListStudentIds` that returns an array of ids from a list of objects.

3. **Filter**: Create a function `getStudentsByLocation` that returns an array of objects for students located in a specific city.

4. **Reduce**: Create a function `getStudentIdsSum` that returns the sum of all student ids.

5. **Combine**: Create a function `updateStudentGradeByCity` that returns an array of students for a specific city with their new grades.

6. **Typed Arrays**: Create a function `createInt8TypedArray` that returns a new ArrayBuffer with an Int8 value at a specific position.

7. **Set data structure**: Create a function `setFromArray` that returns a Set from an array.

8. **More set data structure**: Create a function `hasValuesFromArray` that returns a boolean if all elements in the array exist within the set.

9. **Clean set**: Create a function `cleanSet` that returns a string of set values that start with a specific string.

10. **Map data structure**: Create a function `groceriesList` that returns a map of groceries with specified items and quantities.

11. **More map data structure**: Create a function `updateUniqueItems` that returns an updated map for all items with initial quantity at 1.
